                    We are residents of Prince William County seeking to connect those in need to people who can lend a helping hand. This group was founded by a group of current and former PWCS students. We are expanding our membership to embody the unique diversity found in PWC.

                    The mission of the Prince William County Mutual Aid network is to build community connections to facilitate the material aid to residents of PWC. PWC Mutual Aid is built on collective action by community members to support needs of the community as they arise.

                Our government and local organizations have taken actions trying to support the people of our community, but we have seen that many are falling through the cracks. We are seeking to fill those gaps.
